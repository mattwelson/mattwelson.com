# Preparation

On Friday night I will host my first tabletop RPG. I’ve chosen the first story in the
[Dread handbook](https://www.tiltingatwindmills.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/full-moon-intro.pdf),
you can hear it played on [OneShot](http://oneshotpodcast.com/podcasts/one-shot/14-horror-on-mt-holycross/) or watch it on [Tabletop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0loSZFsyoQ).

## Why Dread?

Dread is a tabletop RPG where instead of rolling dice to determine the success of their characters actions, players pull Jenga blocks from an increasingly rickety tower. Each time the tower falls, someone dies! This makes for a great single sitting format, where some role-playing games can span multiple sessions.
Another plus when playing with a new Game Master and inexperienced players is that you don’t need to worry about numbers. Keeping track of hit points, modifiers and a ton of equipment can be a real challenge for new players and can be a real barrier to investing in the story.
Dread also has 3 great starting scenarios to help a first time host create interesting experiences for all involved. The first story involves a group on a hiking trip trying to decide if they should drag their injured guide along with them as the beast that hurt him continues to hunt them. Do they abandon him? Or will they keep supporting him even if it might cost them their own lives?

## Characters

Even though the Dread scenario has ready to go character questionnaires, we will run the game without any characters. This probably defeats the point of a role-playing game, but it reduces the startup time. Basically, we will sit down — build a tower, pull a brick for each player at the table and then begin!

# Follow up

So, it turns out that my wife is secretly a World Champion at Jenga. She kept pulling bricks after we concluded the game and managed another dozen bricks or so without any trouble. No characters died during the Dread game, but there was still a real tension for every pull. I had a couple of issues running the story but we all enjoyed the experience.

## Slight changes cause big reactions

Instead of waking up and finding the injured guide, I decided that there’d be more tension if they woke up to find him missing. It turns out that the players wouldn’t wonder into the woods to find him, so I tried to lure them in by have him beg for help. This didn’t sway them but it did back me into a corner regarding his injuries, he obviously couldn’t be that injured or that delirious — yet I still wanted him to be a burden and unable to move without help, and unable to tell them what attacked him. I gave up on the latter and he did eventually say it was a werewolf. Because he was such a hassle and I did a poor job of role playing as him, the characters used him as werewolf food to help them get through the night.

Another mistake I made right at the start was to insert a member of the party that disappeared in the initial attack, only to reappear the next night as a stalking werewolf. This had a bigger effect than I expected too, the players weren’t willing to kill him, so they simply avoided him during the nights then moved on the day. This was another weakness of my plan, I’d hoped to have all the action happen in the first night.

Using a modern setting, rather than an 80’s setting, meant that the players just triggered an emergency locator beacon. I was hoping they would attempt an emergency phone call like in OneShot, then I could have ramped up the tension while they wait for a helicopter in an exposed place but in the end I never followed up on this story element.

## The tower of Dread

The Jenga tower was really fun, watching it wobble slightly as a player pulled a brick was always a great moment. Even though all players survived the entire game, the tower still felt menacing. It also seemed like I had more time to think and plan the story than I would have if the players were rolling die.

## Conclusion

The Dread system and example game worked great for a first time GM. I enjoyed the challenge of crafting a compelling narrative, even when the players forced me to fly by the seat of my pants. I don’t know if our next game will be Dread, or if I’ll try to run a Call of Cthulhu or Monster of the week game next, but I’m pretty confident I can run another one. Everyone was generous about mistakes I made, which lead to a great evening. We even had enough time to play the world’s longest game of Settler’s of Catan afterwards.
