Reply all has been releasing great podcast episodes since its inception in 2014. But is episode 158 the best?

> This week, however, Reply All released not only its best-ever episode, but perhaps the best-ever episode of any podcast, in the form of The Missing Hit.

The episode follows an obsessive mind's quest to will a song he remembers back into existance, even when no one else
has any recollection of the catchy, kind of dorky, radio hit.

So if you listened to this episode and loved it, why not dive into the rabit hole of mystery podcasts?

## 99% Invisible

Who Let The Dogs Out! We all know it, but where did the song come from? The Baha Men, right? 
They didn't write the song, they just recorded a version of a song that was already popular. 
In some ways this is the reverse mystery, a song everyone has heard at some point
that has no origin.

## Mystery Show 

The queen of mystery herself, Starlee Kine, is the master of pulling charm and magic from everything she records.
The entire Mystery Show back catalogue is worth listening to, but if we're talking about the one episode to represent the whole
series I can't recommend "Belt Buckle" enough. Follow Starlee as she hunts for a mythical figure, a Swiss Cowboy Chef that towers over everyone, all because
a friend wants to return a belt buckle that is impossibly unique.

## Decoder Ring

Baby Shark has a surprisingly long history that spans the globe. If you've been around a toddler recently you've
probably heard this incredibly catchy, and annoying, song which includes actions. The episode runs through some
different versions and speculates on just why the song is such a success and so easy to get stuck in your head.
