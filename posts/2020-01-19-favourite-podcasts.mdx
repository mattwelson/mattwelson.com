Whenever I am walking, running, working out or working - I normally have my
headphones in (currently Skullcandy Push, a set of TWS headphones) and a
podcast on. The amount of podcasts that are out there is crazy, I've had a few 
conversations with friends that listen as often as I do and there's nearly zero
overlap between what I listen to and what they do.

Here are some of my favourite series, with a recommendation on the first
episode to try. If you want to sleep on a mattress that comes in a box,
while hiring someone to build your website and cook your dinners, you're in
the right place.

### The Dollop
_History at its craziest_

This is my favourite at the moment. The Dollop is an American history
podcast with two comedians, one reading a story to the other. There is now 
a tonne of episodes and all are pretty amazing. 

Check out episode 23 - The Willie Dee

### My Favorite Murder
_True crime comedy_

The MFM podcast comes in two flavours, mini-episodes and the normal episodes. 
Mini-episodes are the hosts reading fan mail with listeners describing their own
encounters with shady characters or stories of murder from their home town. The normal
episodes have each host (Georgia or Karen) reading a true murder story, including the 
background and consequences. 

The podcast is both funny and touching, obviously the subject is dark and won't be for
everyone but like the Dollop it's always handled with empathy and directed at the 
people responsible for the horrible crimes (this is my nit pick with another true 
crime podcast that I won't recommend here). The introductions might be waffley, they 
have vocal fry, whatever. The important stuff is what they're talking about and how 
they handle it.

Check out episode 197 - Grandma Surprise, learn about the origins of Stockholm Syndrome!

### The Adventure Zone
_Three brothers and their dad play Dungeons and Dragons so hard they cry_

The first season of the Adventure Zone is honestly amazing. Absolutely amazing.
The McElroy brothers (of My Brother, My Brother, and Me fame, would recommend that too!)
play Dungeons and Dragons with their dad. Griffin is the GM and does a brilliant job almost
immediately. The first arc is great, but from there is just gets better. I'm torn about
recommending you start at the start, or if you should listen to one of their recent live shows
where they play a totally different game.

Check out episode 1, start from the start

Check out Hootenanny - Live in Nashville, a country western space opera - a one shot game

### How Did This Get Made
_Bad movie reviews with a tonne of laughs_

Bad movie podcasts are pretty common, I love How Did This Get Made, The Flop House and Mostly
Nitpicking. All are worth checking out and are different enough that you can listen to all of them.

HDTGM mainly does live shows now, each one focuses on a terrible movie from Hobbs & Shaw to Harry & Meghan: 
A Royal Romance. 

Check out Drop Dead Fred, the hosts are divided between love and hate. Jason gives himself a headache.

### Hello Internet
_Two dudes talk about YouTube... sometimes_

CGP Grey and Brady Harran from YouTube talk about YouTube, but mainly everything else. In someways they
couldn't be more different. CGP Grey is the ultimate realist, and Brady is almost the ultimate optimist, almost. 
But the show has so much chemistry. The best moments are when Brady just breaks Grey's brain with his relentless
charm.

Check out episode 1, or start anywhere

### 99% Invisible
_Stories about things you don't think about_

Roman Mars presents excellently made stories about design and how it impacts us everyday.
Stories range from how did credit cards become a thing, to what happens if your architecture professor
steals your skyscraper design, to how to tell a good Hawaiian shirt from an average one.

Check out episode 325 - The Worst Way to Start a City, how Oklahoma City was founded in a day 

### Reply All
_Stories about the internet_

Stories about people on the internet, like when one of the hosts befriends a scammer in India and actually 
goes to meet him, an Australian teen that sold his fake company, or a father making a video game that
represents his sons struggle with cancer (bring tissues to that one). 

Check out episode 127 - The Crime Machine, how technology can have a real effect on lives.

Check out episode 28 - Shipped to Timbuktu, an amazing story about prisoners of war trying to offer each other hope.
