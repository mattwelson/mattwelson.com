Over the last few weeks (my first commit was made on 25th August)
I have been working on making a simple travel dairy that I can upload 1-4 photos
from each location of our upcoming America trip.

Check it out here:

## Motivation

I was inspired by the following gif, when it was featured on
[Muzli's weekly interaction roundup](https://medium.muz.li/banking-app-refresh-animation-dashboard-and-more-weekly-interactions-roundup-c79d3679e88d)

Something about the idea of having a small gallery for each day of the trip,
paired with a brief paragraph really resonated with me. I sat down and came up
with a small list of goals for implementing my own version of this.

## Goals

1. Easy to update. My summary of this goal was "I want to be able to update
   the site from the line in a Starbucks", never mind the fact that there won't
   be many Starbucks where we're going!
2. Flex some CSS skills. I wanted the site to look good.
3. Include animations right from the start. Normally animations are added
   as the very last thing, and getting them dialled is is left to the last minute.
4. I wanted the site to be a surprise for my Mum, which might sound like the easiest
   goal on the list but I suck at keeping secrets.

## The build

This was the third site I had made with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) and
[Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). I wanted to really
push what I had learnt on the other two projects (the first of which is this blog, which is due for a tidy up).

Animation! I really enjoyed working with
[Popmotion's React Pose](https://popmotion.io/pose/).
I initially started to animate everything with CSS, but the cool
staggered effect like the menu has just wouldn't have worked.
The other major issue with CSS animations was differentiating between the
initial page load, and subsequent ones. Animations that were running on page load
were really jerky and didn't look very nice.
