### About me

#### _Hello!_

I'm Matt, a programmer living in Whanganui, New Zealand. I love podcasts, reading books, playing [games](/tags/games) and [writing code](/tags/code). Even though desk work doesn't always lend itself to it, I enjoy [powerlifting](/tags/powerlifting).

Sometimes I tweet. [@MattWelson](https://twitter.com/MattWelson)

### My day job

I specialise in ASP .NET MVC, building web applications for a Dunedin-based finance company, where I've been working since November 2013. I graduated with a BSc in Computer Science and Psychology, and a BA in Philosophy. Over the years I've grown to love all things frontend, particularly JavaScript - though I did go through a "I don't need JavaScript, CSS is life!" phase.

### Shout out to my wife

My lovely wife runs her own blog at [Get Out NZ](https://getoutnz.wordpress.com/) featuring walks from across New Zealand, including her talented photography.
